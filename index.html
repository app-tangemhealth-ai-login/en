		<h3>
		Completing Tangem Login Seamlessly     
		</h3>
		<p>
		The overall Tangem Login process is a combination of NFC-based card scanning and an access code or biometric. Both elements are equally important for ensuring enhanced usage. The following steps can be employed for a safe and secure login:  
	    </p>
		<ol>
		<li> <strong>Installing the App: </strong> The first step is to install the app, by completing the app download from the app store of your device. You get access to the interface which helps in ensuring a better Tangem Login.</li>
		<li> <strong> Open and Scan Device: </strong> After launching the app, you must access the “Scan” or “Connect” option. Near the NFC reader of your phone, hold the Tangem card or ring, as the app will detect the device over NFC. </li>
		<li> <strong> Enter Access Code or Biometric: </strong>The app asks you to input the Access Code, after the scanning process is done. You can also authenticate using fingerprint or Face ID if you’ve enabled the biometric aspect. </li>
		<li> <strong>Complete Login and Access Dashboard: </strong>The login process is complete once authenticated, and you can access your dashboard. Get your wallet balances, transaction history, and the options for sending and receiving crypto here.</li>
		<li> <strong> Switching Wallets and Managing Multiple Devices: </strong> Within the app’s interface, you get the chance of swiping or switching between multiple linked devices. Multi-wallet management is supported by the app. 
		</ol>
	    <p>The combination of card scanning and access code, ensures enhanced security in Tangem.</p>

		<h3>
		Troubleshooting in Tangem     
		</h3>
		<p>
		You might end up running into issues sometimes, even with the designed-for-simplicity system of Tangem. Some common and quick fixes in this case involves the following: </p>
		<ol>
		<li>If you’re facing issues of wrong access codes or lockouts, you must reset it. However, this requires you to have a backup. </li>
		<li>In cases where NFC is not reading a card, make sure that the NFC of the phone is active and the card is held flat over the NFC area. You must clean the card surface and check the card orientation of your phone. </li>
		<li>If your app is constantly crashing and there are loading issues, the best solution is to update the app. You can also delete and reinstall the app, after clearing cache from your device. </li>
		<li>Issues of stuck login or app not recognizing your device can be resolved by removing and re-adding the wallet, by re-scanning the device.</li>
		<li>In case your biometric is not working, make sure that the biometric access is allowed in your phone settings and that the device supports the feature. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>In case of persisting issues, make sure that you reach out to the customer support of Tangem or visit the Help Center, to get a detailed overview of the problem. </p>
